## Lab 1

### App Description
Created a basic flashcard app with a question in the front and the answer in the back revealable by a tap on the card. I added multiple choices for the user to guess the answer. Upon clicking the right answer, the answer is revealed on the card as well. Also added some design such as a background image in the app and the card, and styled the cards to better distinguish between the question and answer sides.
